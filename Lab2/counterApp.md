# Modify the Counter App template to work with your app

For this tutorial, we have modified a basic version of the `create-react-app` template to support working with Pera Wallet and Algorand.

To start with, we need to clone the repository for the template.

```bash
https://github.com/Algo-Hub-io/counter-app.git
```
This will download the counter app template to our local machine.
